## Managing Multiple Recipients

### Example Setup
```
Menu Picker â†’ Manage Email Recipients
Enter: mom@family.com, dad@family.com, sister@family.com

Result: All three people will receive the weekly menu email every Friday at 9 AM
```

### Use Cases
- **Family**: Send to all family members so everyone knows the meal plan
- **Roommates**: Share the weekly menu with people you live with
- **Meal Prep Group**: Coordinate meals with friends who meal prep together
- **Caregivers**: Keep caregivers informed of meal plans

## How Meal History Works

### Automatic Tracking
- The system remembers your last 8 weeks of menus
- When generating a new menu, it checks the last 4 weeks
- If a meal combination (meat + starch + veggie) was used recently, it tries to pick different sides
- This ensures variety without repeating the same meals too often

### Example
**Week 1:** Chicken Breast + Rice + Broccoli
**Week 2:** The system will avoid "Chicken Breast + Rice + Broccoli" but could use:
- Chicken Breast + Pasta + Carrots âœ…
- Chicken Thighs + Rice + Broccoli âœ…
- Grilled Chicken + Rice + Green Beans âœ…

### Viewing Your History
Click **Menu Picker â†’ View Meal History** to see what you've eaten in the past 8 weeks.
