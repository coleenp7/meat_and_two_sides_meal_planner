## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Your Google Sheet

1. Create a new Google Sheet
2. Set up your data with the following structure:
   - **Column A (Meat)**: List your meat options (e.g., "Chicken Breast", "Pork Chops", "Fish Fillet", "Shrimp")
   - **Column B (Starch)**: List your starch options (e.g., "Rice", "Pasta", "Potatoes")
   - **Column C (Veggie)**: List your vegetable options (e.g., "Broccoli", "Carrots", "Green Beans")
3. Add headers in Row 1 (optional): "Meat", "Starch", "Veggie" - these will be automatically ignored
4. Start your data from Row 2

**Note:** The script automatically filters out common header labels (meat, starch, veggie, veggies, vegetable, vegetables) so you can label your columns however you like.

**Example:**
```
|   A (Meat)      |   B (Starch)   |   C (Veggie)    |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Meat            | Starch         | Veggie          |

## Usage

### Manual Menu Generation

To test the menu picker without sending an email:
1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Generate Weekly Menu**
2. The weekly menu will appear in columns E-H of your sheet

### Test Email

To test sending an email:
1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Test Email**
2. You'll receive an email with the weekly menu at your Google account email

### Automatic Weekly Emails

Once you've set up the trigger (Step 5), the extension will automatically:
- **Start sending emails immediately** on the next Friday at 9 AM
- Generate a new weekly menu each week
- Send it to your email address
- The menu will cover the upcoming week starting from Sunday
- Check for special dates and include special meals automatically

### Configure Email Start Date (Optional)

**By default, emails start immediately.** Only use this if you want to delay when emails begin.

To delay email sending to a future date:

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Configure Email Start Date**
2. Enter a date in MM/DD/YYYY format (e.g., 12/25/2025)
3. The trigger will run weekly, but emails will only be sent on or after this date
4. To resume immediate sending, leave the field blank and click OK

**Use Cases:**
- Set up the system now but start emails later (e.g., after vacation)
- Temporarily pause emails by setting a future date
- Resume immediate sending by clearing the start date

**Note:** By default, no start date is set and emails begin immediately. The trigger runs every Friday at 9 AM and checks the start date before sending (if one is configured).

## Managing Special Dates

### Adding a Special Date

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Add Special Date**
2. Enter the date in MM-DD format (e.g., 12-25 for December 25)
3. Enter a name for the special occasion (e.g., "Mom's Birthday", "Anniversary")
4. Enter the specific meat, starch, and veggie for that special meal
5. The special meal will automatically appear in your weekly menu when that date occurs

### Viewing Special Dates

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **View Special Dates**
2. See a list of all saved special dates and their meals

### Removing a Special Date

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Remove Special Date**
2. Enter the date (MM-DD) you want to remove

**Note:** Special dates are stored permanently and will be used every year on that date. Special meals are highlighted in gold in the email and display.

## Managing Email Recipients

### Adding or Updating Recipients

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Manage Email Recipients**
2. View current recipients list
3. Enter new email addresses separated by commas (e.g., `mom@email.com, dad@email.com, me@email.com`)
4. Click OK to save

**Note:** This replaces the entire list with the new addresses you enter.

### Removing a Recipient

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Remove Email Recipient**
2. View the numbered list of current recipients
3. Enter either:
   - The number of the recipient to remove (e.g., `2`)
   - The email address to remove (e.g., `dad@email.com`)
4. Click OK to confirm

**Default:** If no recipients are set, emails will be sent to the Google account running the script.

**Tip:** You can add as many recipients as you want. Everyone will receive the same weekly menu.

## Meal History Tracking

The menu picker automatically tracks your last 8 weeks of menus and tries to avoid repeating the exact same meal combinations (meat + starch + veggie) within the last 4 weeks.

### View History

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **View Meal History**
2. See a summary of your past 8 weeks of menus

### Clear History

1. Click **Menu Picker** ‚Üí **Clear Meal History**
2. Confirm to reset the history (useful if you want to start fresh)

**Note:** History is used to provide variety but won't prevent a menu if it's the only valid option based on all the constraints.

## Customization

### Change Email Recipients (Programmatically)

**Recommended:** Use **Menu Picker ‚Üí Manage Email Recipients** from the UI instead.

### Mobile Email Display

Emails are automatically optimized for mobile devices:
- On desktop/tablets: Full table with all columns visible
- On mobile phones: Date column is hidden to fit smaller screens
- Responsive fonts and padding adjust to screen size
- Special dates highlighted in gold on all devices

### Modify Meat Type Limits

To change the weekly limits for meat types:

1. Open the Apps Script editor
2. Find the `LIMITS` constant at the top of the code
3. Modify the values:
   ```javascript
   const LIMITS = {
     'chicken': 3,  // Change this number
     'pork': 2,     // Change this number
     'fish': 1,     // Change this number
     'shrimp': 1,   // Change this number
     'beef': 0      // Change to 2 or more to allow beef
   };
   ```

### Change Email Schedule

To change when the email is sent:

1. Open the Apps Script editor
2. Find the `setupWeeklyTrigger()` function
3. Modify these lines:
   ```javascript
   .onWeekDay(ScriptApp.WeekDay.FRIDAY)  // Change the day
   .atHour(9)  // Change the hour (0-23)
   ```

### Change Timezone

1. Open `appsscript.json` in the Apps Script editor
2. Update the `timeZone` value to your timezone
3. Find valid timezone strings here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors

**Error: "Specified permissions are not sufficient to call Session.getActiveUser"**

This means the script needs re-authorization with updated permissions:

1. Open Apps Script editor
2. Ensure `appsscript.json` includes all required OAuth scopes (see Step 4)
3. Save the file
4. Run the `onOpen` function again
5. Click "Review Permissions" and re-authorize
6. The error should be resolved

**Why this happens:** The script needs permission to access your email address for default recipient setup.

### Menu Not Generating

- **Check your data**: Ensure you have items in columns A, B, and C starting from row 2
- **Check for empty rows**: Make sure there are no completely empty rows in your data
- **Minimum requirements**: At least 7 meats, 4 starches, and 4 veggies recommended

### Email Not Sending

- **Check authorization**: Re-run the authorization process (Step 4) with all required permissions
- **Check trigger**: Go to Apps Script ‚Üí **Triggers** (‚è∞) to verify the trigger is set up
- **Check email recipients**: Use Menu Picker ‚Üí Manage Email Recipients to verify addresses
- **Check start date**: Use Menu Picker ‚Üí Configure Email Start Date to ensure no future date is blocking emails

### Limits Not Working

- **Check meat names**: The script identifies meat types by looking for keywords in the item names:
  - Items containing "chicken" ‚Üí counted as chicken
  - Items containing "pork" ‚Üí counted as pork
  - Items containing "fish" ‚Üí counted as fish
  - Items containing "shrimp" ‚Üí counted as shrimp
  - Items containing "beef" ‚Üí counted as beef
- **Case insensitive**: "Chicken", "chicken", and "CHICKEN" all work
- **Be specific**: If you want items counted properly, include the meat type in the name

### Deleting All Triggers

If you need to remove all automatic triggers:
1. Open the Apps Script editor
2. Click on **Triggers** (‚è∞) in the left sidebar
3. Delete triggers manually, OR
4. Run the `deleteAllTriggers()` function from the editor
