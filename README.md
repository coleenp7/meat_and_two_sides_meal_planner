## Customization

### Change Email Recipients (Programmatically)

**Recommended:** Use **Menu Picker ‚Üí Manage Email Recipients** from the UI instead.

### Mobile Email Display

Emails are automatically optimized for mobile devices:
- On desktop/tablets: Full table with all columns visible
- On mobile phones: Date column is hidden to fit smaller screens
- Responsive fonts and padding adjust to screen size
- Special dates highlighted in gold on all devices

### Modify Meat Type Limits

To change the weekly limits for meat types:

1. Open the Apps Script editor
2. Find the `LIMITS` constant at the top of the code
3. Modify the values:
   ```javascript
   const LIMITS = {
     'chicken': 3,  // Change this number
     'pork': 2,     // Change this number
     'fish': 1,     // Change this number
     'shrimp': 1,   // Change this number
     'beef': 0      // Change to 2 or more to allow beef
   };
   ```

### Change Email Schedule

To change when the email is sent:

1. Open the Apps Script editor
2. Find the `setupWeeklyTrigger()` function
3. Modify these lines:
   ```javascript
   .onWeekDay(ScriptApp.WeekDay.FRIDAY)  // Change the day
   .atHour(9)  // Change the hour (0-23)
   ```

### Change Timezone

1. Open `appsscript.json` in the Apps Script editor
2. Update the `timeZone` value to your timezone
3. Find valid timezone strings here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones

## Troubleshooting

### Menu Not Generating

- **Check your data**: Ensure you have items in columns A, B, and C starting from row 2
- **Check for empty rows**: Make sure there are no completely empty rows in your data

### Email Not Sending

- **Check authorization**: Re-run the authorization process (Step 5)
- **Check trigger**: Go to Apps Script ‚Üí **Triggers** (‚è∞) to verify the trigger is set up
- **Check email address**: Verify the email address in the code

### Limits Not Working

- **Check meat names**: The script identifies meat types by looking for keywords in the item names:
  - Items containing "chicken" ‚Üí counted as chicken
  - Items containing "pork" ‚Üí counted as pork
  - Items containing "fish" ‚Üí counted as fish
  - Items containing "shrimp" ‚Üí counted as shrimp
- **Case insensitive**: "Chicken", "chicken", and "CHICKEN" all work
- **Be specific**: If you want items counted properly, include the meat type in the name

### Deleting All Triggers

If you need to remove all automatic triggers:
1. Open the Apps Script editor
2. Click on **Triggers** (‚è∞) in the left sidebar
3. Delete triggers manually, OR
4. Run the `deleteAllTriggers()` function from the editor
